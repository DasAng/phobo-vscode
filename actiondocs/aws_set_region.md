## Set region

This action will set the AWS region to use.

This action will fail if the region is empty.

- `<region>`: the region value, fx: *eu-central-1* or *eu-west-1* etc.

The matching is case insensitive and can appear anywhere within the sentence.

Example of usage:

- Set the aws region to *us-east-1*:

    > `aws region us-east-1`
